I had a wonderful experience today at the Turkish Radio and Television (TRT) Corporation, which is the oldest and one of the most (if not the most) popular radio stations in Turkey. They invited me to the radio to talk about my experience in the US as a PhD student and then as a researcher. We talked about hybrid electric aircraft, the enabling technologies and gender equality in STEM. Interesting fact: Turkey has one of the highest female-to-male student ratio in STEM in the world. However, this ratio drops dramatically when it comes to the industry.
