Hi there! My name is Gökçin Çınar. I work as a Research Engineer II at [Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory](https://www.asdl.gatech.edu/) (ASDL) at **Georgia** Institute of **Tech**nology.

My main research interests include electrified aircraft propulsion and power, aircraft systems architecting, design and integration, and power management optimization. Since 2012, I've been involved in a range of projects including but not limited to future aircraft technologies, green aviation, electrified aircraft and its propulsion subsystems, thermal management systems, and model-based systems engineering.

As a research engineer at ASDL, I lead or work with multi-disciplinary groups to conduct fundamental research funded by various sponsors from the industry and government. I advise graduate students on their projects and theses. As someone who likes to add their own touch to their "habitat", I also kick-started or rekindled some projects at ASDL that were not necessarily in my job definition. I manage [ASDL's website](https://www.asdl.gatech.edu/) and social media accounts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asdl_gatech), [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/asdl_gatech/)and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2407/). I rekindled the [ASDL publication repository](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/6027) on Georgia Tech's open-access publication repository, SMARTech, where you can find the many research papers and dissertations published by ASDL over the years. I started the ASDL Knowledge Sharing Project which provides a platform for researchers to share their experience, codes, tools, documents, or Q&A's.

I received my Master's and Ph.D. degrees in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2015 and 2018, respectively. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey in 2012.

I am a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). Within AIAA, I am a member of the Energy Optimized Aircraft Systems Integration Committee and the Aircraft Electrified Propulsion and Power Working Group. I am also involved in the organizing committee for AIAA/IEEE Electric Aircraft Technologies Symposium in 2020.

Back in 2016, I started a [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/BizsizOnlar) (content is in Turkish only) to promote STEM and gender equality in STEM. Together with my husband, Efe Yamaç Yarbaşı, we shoot fun videos about interesting research we read in scientific articles, our own experience in academia, and various other topics related to STEM. One of my favorite free-time activities is to interact with our young followers who want to be an aerospace engineer or in the process of making one.
