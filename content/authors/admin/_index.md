As a research engineer at ASDL, I lead or work with multi-disciplinary groups to conduct fundamental research funded by various sponsors from the industry and government. I advise graduate students on their projects and theses. As someone who likes to add their own touch to their "habitat", I also kick-started or rekindled some projects at ASDL that were not necessarily in my job definition. I manage [ASDL's website](https://www.asdl.gatech.edu/) and social media accounts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asdl_gatech), [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/asdl_gatech/)and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2407/). I rekindled the [ASDL publication repository](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/6027) on Georgia Tech's open-access publication repository, SMARTech, where you can find the many research papers and dissertations published by ASDL over the years. I started the ASDL Knowledge Sharing Project which provides a platform for researchers to share their experience, codes, tools, documents, or Q&A's.

Hi there! My name is Gökçin Çınar. I currently work as a Research Engineer II at [Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory](https://www.asdl.gatech.edu/) (ASDL) at **Georgia** Institute of **Tech**nology.

New announcement:  **I'll be joining the [Aerospace Engineering Department](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan as an Assistant Professor in January 2022.** Prospective and current UM students: If you are interested in pursuing your Master's or Ph.D. degree or doing research as an undergrad with me in the research areas listed below, please contact me!

My main research interests include aerospace systems architecting, integration, and design with a special focus on electrified aircraft concepts and sustainable aviation. In my research, I utilize probabilistic and statistical methods and techniques for surrogate modeling, machine learning, design space exploration and decision making to analyze, understand and design the complex system behavior of an aerospace vehicle. Since 2012, I've been involved in a range of projects including future aircraft technologies, green aviation, electrified aircraft and its propulsion subsystems, thermal management systems, and model-based systems engineering.

I received my Master's and Ph.D. degrees in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2015 and 2018, respectively. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey in 2012. My doctoral dissertation titled “*Methodology for Dynamic Sizing of Electric Power Generation and Distribution Architectures*” was conducted in consultation with [Prof. Dimitri Mavris](https://www.asdl.gatech.edu/Faculty.html) at Georgia Tech. As part of my Ph.D. work, I created a parametric, physics-based novel aircraft design and analysis framework and a software called “*Electrified Propulsion Architecture Sizing and Synthesis (E-PASS)*”. E-PASS has since enabled various new research topics funded by entities such as NASA, AFRL, and Boeing. 

I am a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). I am currently serving as the Publications and Policy Chair of AIAA's Electrified Aircraft Technical Committee. For the past 3 years I have been a member of the Organizing Committee for the AIAA/IEEE Electric Aircraft Technologies Symposium (EATS). I am the Technical Program Chair of EATS 2022, which will be held jointly with the [IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference (ITEC)](https://itec-conf.com/) this upcoming year. Check out the [Call for Papers for ITEC & EATS here](https://itec-conf.com/itec/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Call-For-PapersV4.pdf), and stand by for the EATS Student Design Competition!

Back in 2016, I started a [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/BizsizOnlar) (for now the contents are in Turkish only) to promote STEM and gender equality in STEM. Together with my husband, Efe Yamaç Yarbaşı, we shoot fun videos about interesting research we read in scientific articles, our own experience in academia, and various other topics related to STEM. Although we hardly ever find the time to shoot new videos for a long while now, I very much enjoy interacting with our young followers who want to be an aerospace engineer or in the process of making one. As part of this outreach, I also give invited talks and seminars at high schools, universities, and local and social media platforms.
