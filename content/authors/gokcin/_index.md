Gökçin Çınar (pronounced as gok-chin chin-r) is an **assistant professor of aerospace engineering** at the **University of Michigan**. She is the **Principal Investigator of Integrated Design of Environmentally-friendly Aerospace Systems (IDEAS) Lab**. Her research interests include **aerospace systems design, integration, and optimization** with a special focus on e**lectrified aircraft concepts and sustainable aviation**. In her research, she utilizes **model-based engineering** along with **probabilistic and statistical methods** to analyze, understand and design the **complex system behavior** of an aerospace vehicle. 

Prior to her role at Michigan, Dr. Cinar worked as a Research Engineer at Georgia Institute of Technology where she oversaw a range of government and industry funded research projects on future aircraft technologies, green aviation, electrified aircraft and its propulsion subsystems, thermal management systems, and model-based systems engineering.

Dr. Cinar holds Ph.D. and MSc. degrees in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech, and a Bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from Middle East Technical University. Her doctoral dissertation titled “[Methodology for Dynamic Sizing of Electric Power Generation and Distribution Architectures](http://hdl.handle.net/1853/60754)” was conducted in consultation with [Prof. Dimitri Mavris](https://www.asdl.gatech.edu/Faculty.html) at Georgia Tech. As part of her Ph.D. work, I developed a parametric, physics-based novel aircraft design and analysis framework and a software called “Electrified Propulsion Architecture Sizing and Synthesis (**E-PASS**)”. E-PASS has since enabled various new research topics funded by NASA, AFRL, and Boeing.

Dr. Cinar is a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). She is currently serving as the Publications and Policy Chair of AIAA's Electrified Aircraft Technology Technical Committee. For the past 3 years she has been a member of the Organizing Committee for the AIAA/IEEE Electric Aircraft Technologies Symposium (EATS). She is the Publication Co-Chair of [2022 IEEE/AIAA Transportation Electrification Conference and Electric Aircraft Technologies Symposium (ITEC+EATS)](https://itec-conf.com/).

Dr. Cinar is also passionate about science communication. Since 2016, she has been involved in outreach activities to promote STEM and gender equality in STEM. As part of this outreach, she owns a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/BizsizOnlar) (only in Turkish) and gives invited talks and seminars at high schools, universities, and local and social media platforms.
