**I**ntegrated **D**esign of **E**nvironmentally-friendly **A**erospace **S**ystems<br>

Research at IDEAS Lab aims to bring a **holistic approach** that accounts for the **system-level and life-cycle** impact of greenhouse gas emissions in the **design and operation of novel aircraft concepts**. We explore the **new aircraft design space** created by **revolutionary aerospace technologies** to **maximize the environmental and operational benefits** through the use of **physics-based modeling, probabilistic design methods** and **integrated systems engineering** approaches.

### Current research topics include:
- Aerospace systems design, integration, optimization
- Sustainable aviation with a special focus on electrified and hydrogen-powered aircraft concepts
- Statistical and probabilistic design methods
- Surrogate modeling and machine learning
- Model-based systems engineering

### Electrified Propulsion Architecture Sizing and Synthesis: E-PASS
Developed by Dr. Cinar, E-PASS is an energy-based aircraft sizing and synthesis tool in MATLAB. **E-PASS enables conceptual design and performance evaluation of advanced aircraft concepts with *any* type of propulsion architecture** (including non-electrified), and allows for rapid comparisons between **diverse architectures *and* their operations**. E-PASS is powered by **parametric, physics-based** electric powertrain models. It serves as a **modular multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization** framework for **novel aircraft conceptual design**. Since 2018, the E-PASS software has enabled multiple research projects funded by the government and industry, including NASA, AFRL, and Boeing.

### Design Space Exploration and Optimization
Traditionally, important design decisions are made and locked in at early design stages where knowledge about the design is limited and the methods rely on historical data. This results in a point design that can only be locally optimized for a predetermined set of requirements. At IDEAS Lab, we leverage **probabilistic design methods** to predict the effects of **random variability** and **mitigate uncertainties** associated with novel concepts. We strategically and efficiently **sample and perturb the design space of a complex system** to predict the system response including the **random variability effects**. We utilize statistical methods to build **computationally faster reduced order models**. This approach enables the creation of a **fast, dynamic, and interactive design space exploration and optimization environment**. This way we can perform the simulation and evaluation of *thousands* of sized designs, optimized under varying requirements - all of this *at the click of a button*! This environment can be used to perform **"what-if" analysis, visualize the sensitivities** of design factors to the system-level responses, make **informed decisions** about the design, and more.
