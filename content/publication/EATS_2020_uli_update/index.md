abstract: "Under the NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI) program, a team of universities are collaborating on the advancement of technologies a hybrid turboelectric regional jet, with an intent to enter service in the 2030 timeframe. In the previous studies of the ULI program, the in-service benefits of the technologies under development were analyzed by integrating the technologies of interest to a 2030 regional jet with a hybrid turbo-electric distributed propulsion system. As the program has progressed, the projected performances for each technology and subsystem have been updated. This paper presents an update in the sizing and performance analysis of the regional jet with the hybrid turbo-electric distributed propulsion system, by integrating the updated values of the technologies and subsystems to the vehicle. The updates in this paper include the DC/AC conversion links, efficiency of generator and cabling losses, weight of the wires, the battery cooling through the environmental control system, motor and inverter cooling by the thermal management system, and the redundancy strategy of the propulsion system. The updates of the results from the integrated model include the overall efficiency of the propulsion system, mission fuel savings, mission energy flow distribution, and the optimal hybridization rate in climb and cruise. The overall fuel saving benefit for the target 600-nmi mission is 19.9% compared to the baseline aircraft."
